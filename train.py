# When training the discriminator, we feed in real images that are downscaled to match the current resolution
# of the network."

# "We start with $4 \times 4$ resolution and train the networks until we have shown the discriminator
# 800k real images in total. We then alternate between two phases: fade in the first 3-layer block
# during the next 800k images, stabilize the networks for 800k images, fade in the next 3-layer block
# during 800k images, etc."

# "GANs are prone to the escalation of signal magnitudes as a result of unhealthy competition
# between the two networks. We believe that the actual need in GANs is constraining signal magnitudes
# and competition. We use a different approach that consists of two ingredients, neither of which
# include learnable parameters."

# "EQUALIZED LEARNING RATE: W use a trivial $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ initialization and then
# explicitly scale the weights at runtime. We set $w^{^}_{i} = w_{i} / c$, where $w_{i}$ are the weights
# and $c$ is the per-layer normalization constant from Heâ€™s initializer."

# 800_000 / (10_057 + 17_943)

# "Our latent vectors correspond to random points on a 512-dimensional hypersphere."
